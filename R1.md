## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2020

### Day 1: September 22. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time installing, configuring and documenting how to use the AWS CLI version 2 docker image [see](https://github.com/cpitre/aws_cli_v2_docker/commit/f3dd1f64c5b258e98d01fff7a01f40f3906622fe).  

**Thoughts:** It's nice to leverage containers as 'tools' to consume/leverage and not 'pollute' your development node.
