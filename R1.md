## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2020

### Day 1: September 22. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time installing, configuring and documenting how to use the AWS CLI version 2 docker image [see](https://github.com/cpitre/aws_cli_v2_docker/commit/f3dd1f64c5b258e98d01fff7a01f40f3906622fe).  

**Thoughts:** It's nice to leverage containers as 'tools' to consume/leverage and not 'pollute' your development node.

### Day 2: September 23. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Created and committed (in GitHub) my resume written in markdown format. It will be used to later to create various formats for end user consumption and maintainance. Using https://github.com/williamsmj/resume.md as base for this code base. [see](https://github.com/cpitre/resume).  

**Thoughts:** Will be used to produce different required file formats.  May use something like YAML for data structuring, and Ansible for template file creation (markdown).
